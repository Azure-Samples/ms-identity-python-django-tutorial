# Tutorial: Enable your Java Servlet web app to sign in users and call APIs with the Microsoft identity platform

The [Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-overview), along with [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) (Azure AD) and [Azure Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview) (Azure AD B2C) are central to the **Azure** cloud ecosystem. This tutorial aims to take you through the fundamentals of modern authentication using the [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for Java](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java)

We recommend following the chapters in successive order. However, the code samples are self-contained, so feel free to pick samples by topics that you may need at the moment.

> :warning: This is a *work in progress*. Come back frequently to discover more samples.

## Prerequisites

- [JDK Version 15](https://jdk.java.net/15/). This sample has been developed on Java 15 but should be compatible with some lower versions.
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [Tomcat 9](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [VS Code Azure Tools Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack)

Please refer to each chapter's README for sample-specific prerequisites.

## Recommendations

- Some familiarity with the [Java / Jakarta Servlets](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.servlet)
- Some familiarity with Linux/OSX terminal or Windows PowerShell
- [jwt.ms](https://jwt.ms) for inspecting your tokens.
- [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) for monitoring your network activity and troubleshooting.
- Follow the [Azure AD Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directory-identity/bg-p/Identity) to stay up-to-date with the latest developments.

Please refer to each sample's README for sample-specific recommendations.
